# Real-Time-Face-Detection

This project uses MATLAB's Computer Vision Toolbox to capture live video feed from a webcam and detect faces in real-time using the vision.CascadeObjectDetector function. The detected faces are annotated with bounding boxes and displayed continuously until the user exits the program.

Requirements:

MATLAB: Version R2014a or later
Computer Vision Toolbox
MATLAB Support Package for USB Webcams (if using an external USB webcam)
